          We make all of this stuff collaboratively in Ontario, Canada, where we combine
          the resources and talent of a world-class company with the ethos of a small
          startup. With an engaged and vocal community of partners and players, our
          products and our company will continue to change and grow in ways we may never
          have predicted.We created Boroji in 2003 to serve as a digital content
          distribution channel, before app stores existed. It's since grown and evolved
          into a platform for thousands of creators and publishers to deliver content and
          establish direct relationships with their customers. The Boroji Community
          enables millions of players to do likewise, sharing entertainment and ideas, and
          making friends.

          We make consumer electronic devices that improve exercise on the PC. Things like
          the Boroji Controller and the Boroji Link. We invented the Boroji technologies
          that power the VR, an interactive VR system brought to market in partnership
          with Boroji Inc. Just as in software development, we conduct playtests and share
          prototypes with our partners and players.
