            We make all of this stuff collaboratively in Ontario, Canada, where we combine
            the resources and talent of a world-class company with the ethos of a small
            startup. With an engaged and vocal community of partners and players, our
            products and our company will continue to change and grow in ways we may never
            have predicted.We created Boroji in 2003 to serve as a digital content
            distribution channel, before app stores existed. It's since grown and evolved
            into a platform for thousands of creators and publishers to deliver content
            and establish direct relationships with their customers. The Boroji Community
            enables millions of players to do likewise, sharing entertainment and ideas,
            and making friends.

            We make consumer electronic devices that improve exercise on the PC. Things
            like the Boroji Controller and the Boroji Link. We invented the Boroji
            technologies that power the VR, an interactive VR system brought to market in
            partnership with Boroji Inc. Just as in software development, we conduct
            playtests and share prototypes with our partners and players.
